"Sorry.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA

"Mom. Pop.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Let's take a look, see what's going on here.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I see you shaved off a pound since we saw you last.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Must be making room for all that Halloween candy.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What's your favorite candy?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Desert island candy, if you had to pick one?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA

"Come on.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Life or death situation, what would you pick?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I guess... Reese's Pieces.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Reese's Pieces.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Good call. Good call.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I'm more of a Mounds guy,","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"but I gotta say, peanut butter and chocolate, come on, hard to beat that.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"All right, tell me what's going on with you.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Tell me about this episode you had.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Well, my friends were there and then they just weren't,","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"and I was back there again.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"In the Upside Down?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"All right, so what happened next?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I heard this noise, and so I went outside, and it was worse.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"How was it worse?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"There was this storm.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Okay. So how did you feel when you saw the storm?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I felt...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"frozen.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Heart racing?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Just frozen.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"No. Like how you feel when you're scared,","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"and you can't breathe or talk or do anything.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I felt... felt this evil, like it was looking at me.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It was evil?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Well... What do you think the evil wanted?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"To kill.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"To kill you?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Not me.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Everyone else.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"All right, I'm gonna be honest with you.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It's probably gonna get worse before it gets better.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Worse? He's already had two episodes this month.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"He'll likely have more before the month is out.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It's called the Anniversary Effect. And we've seen this with soldiers.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"The anniversary of an event brings back traumatic memories.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Sort of opens up the neurological floodgates, so to speak.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"So what does this mean for the kid?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Yeah, that. Maybe some personality changes.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"He might get irritable. He might lash out.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What do we do when that happens?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Okay. Well, from what we know about post-traumatic stress...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"And we're still learning, okay? Just treat him normally.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Be patient with him. Don't pressure him to talk.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Just let him lead the way.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I'm sorry, what you're saying is it's gonna get worse and worse","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"and we're just supposed to pretend it's not happening?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It sounds counterintuitive, I know.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"But I assure you that is really the best thing you can do for him.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Listen. I understand what you went through last year. I get it.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"But those people are gone. They're gone. Okay?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"So if we're gonna get through this,","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I just... I need you to realize I'm on your side.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I need you to trust me.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"""Trust me""?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Are you kidding me?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Yeah, I know.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"But, you know, university gives out a degree, this guy's got it.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"And look, that post-traumatic stuff he's talking about, that stuff is real.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"He's gonna be okay. All right?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"How's Bob the Brain?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Don't call him that.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Sorry. Old habit.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"He's good. We're good.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Good. I'm happy for you.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Really. Hey...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Things get worse, you call me first.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"You call me.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Okay.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"They're ready for you, sir.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Patty.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Sam.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Afternoon, sir.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Looks like another hot one today, huh?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Never gets old, sir.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Still no sign?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Jack shit.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Oh! Damn it. My mom's gonna murder me.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"So go home. I'll radio if she comes.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Oh, yeah, nice try. You just want me out of here so you can make your move.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Oh, 'cause you're such a threat.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"That's right.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"She will not be able to resist these pearls.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Ten o'clock. Ten o'clock.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA

"God. You're so stupid.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"She's incredible.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"She's...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Mad Max.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"After dinner, I want you to pick out your toys for the yard sale.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Fine.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Two boxes' worth.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Two boxes?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"You heard me.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I'm fine with you giving away a couple,","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"but the other ones have way too much emotional value.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Emotional value?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"They're hunks of plastic, Michael.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"You already took away my Atari.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Didn't wanna lose more toys, you shouldn't have stolen from Nancy.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I didn't steal. I borrowed.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr. Kowalski last week either, right?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Or plagiarize that essay? Or graffiti the bathroom stall?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"So if your friend jumps off a cliff, you're gonna jump, too?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"We know you've had a hard year, Michael. But we've been patient.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"This isn't strike one. This isn't even strike three.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It's strike 20. You're on the bench, son.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"And if it'd been my coach, you'd be lucky to still be on the team.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Two boxes. Two.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Okay. Ready?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Okay.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I'm so sorry I didn't get to cook.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I was gonna make that baked ziti you guys like so much,","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA

"""Oh, my God, it's five o'clock.""","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It's fine. It's great.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Right. I love KFC.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"So, I noticed a ""For Sale"" sign out in your yard.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Is that the neighbors', or...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"You wanna tell them?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Go ahead.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"We hired a man named Murray Bauman. Have either of you heard of him?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"No.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"No, I don't think so.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"He was an investigative journalist for the Chicago Sun-Times.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"He's pretty well known.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Anyway, he's freelance now, and he agreed to take the case.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"That's... That's great.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"No, that's really... That's great, right?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Um, what exactly does that mean?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Means he's gonna do what that lazy son of a bitch Jim Hop...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Sorry.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What the Hawkins police haven't been capable of doing.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Means we have a real detective on the case.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It means...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"we're going to find our Barb.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"If anyone can find her, it's this man.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"He already has leads. By God, he's worth every last penny.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Is that why you're selling the house?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Don't worry about us, sweetie. We're fine.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"More than fine.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"For the first time in a long time, we're hopeful.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA

"It's day 352, 7:40 p.m.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I'm still here.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"If you're out there, say something. Or give me a sign.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I won't even say anything. Just... I wanna know if you're okay.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I'm so stupid.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Mike.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Mike?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA

"Yeah, it's me, Dustin. What're you doing on this channel again?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I've been trying to reach you all day. We were right. Max is Mad Max.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Yeah, I'm busy.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"But...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What do we do now?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"We stick to the plan.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Mike's not gonna like it.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Last time I checked, our party is not a dictatorship.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It's a democracy.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What if Max says no?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"How can Max say no to these?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I told you to stop that.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I'll see you tomorrow.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Later.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Mews!","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Mews.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Stop. Stop!","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Come on, you gotta get used to it. This is the future.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Well, put the future down and get me a clean bowl.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA

"Whatever you want.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"All right.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What are you working on?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Me.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Did someone call you that?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Hey. You can talk to me. You know that, right?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Whatever happened. Will, come on, talk to me.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Stop treating me like that.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What? Like what?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Like everyone else. Like there's something wrong with me.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What are you talking about?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Mom, Dustin, Lucas. Everyone.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"They all treat me like I'm gonna break.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Like I'm a baby. Like I can't handle things on my own.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It doesn't help. It just makes me feel like more of a freak.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"You're not a freak.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Yeah, I am.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I am.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"You know what? You're right.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"You are a freak.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"No, I'm serious. You're a freak.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"But what? Do you wanna be normal? Do you wanna be just like everyone else?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Is that why you don't have any friends?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I have friends, Will.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Then why are you always hanging out with me?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Because you're my best friend, all right?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"And I would rather be best friends with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"You know what I mean?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Okay, look...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Who would you rather be friends with? Bowie or Kenny Rogers?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Ugh.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Exactly. It's no contest.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"The thing is, nobody normal","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"You got it?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Well...","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"some people like Kenny Rogers.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Kenny Rogers.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"I love Kenny Rogers.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What's so funny?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Nothing.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Mr. Mom. Perfect!","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Where's Mommy keep the extra diapers?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Hey! Cowards.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Hey.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It's okay. Let it go.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA

"Okay.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Holy mackerel!","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Let it go.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Aw, man!","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Hey, what'd we talk about?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"No signal.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"What?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"No signal.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"It's 8-1-5. You're late.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Yeah, I lost track of time. I'll signal next time, all right?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Uh, and it's 8:15. It's not 8-1-5.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Eight-fifteen.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Now, what did we talk about?","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA
"Dinner first, then dessert. Always.","Chapter One MADMAX","2","1",NA

"We'll explain everything.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"Try Dustin again.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He's not answering.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So, try him again.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Dustin, do you copy?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"Well, you know...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I could just take him out.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Take who out?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The Russian guard.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What? I sneak up behind him,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I knock him out, and I take his keycard. It's easy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Did you not hear the part about the massive gun?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yes, Dustin, I did.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And that's why I would be sneaking.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"Twice. Jonathan. Year prior?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Listen, that doesn't count.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Why wouldn't it? Because it looks like he beat the shit out of you.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It was...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"If he gets us the layout by noon, we can.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Okay, I'll let him know.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"Jonathan.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I've worked at this paper for twenty-five years.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Twenty-five...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"years.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Now, we're a small-town paper,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"but we have something the big papers don't have:","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"trust.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The trust of our community.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Tom, if you just...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Do you know how I built that trust? By placing my faith in something","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"the two of you don't seem to value a whole lot:","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"facts.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Facts.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So, while we're here, let's go over the facts.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order to stop pursuing this story.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Two: you falsely identified yourselves as reporters,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Three: you broke into her home, committing trespass.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Four: she almost died en route to the hospital.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"She would've died if we hadn't shown up!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Whatever disease that rat had clearly passed to her...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Five! Mrs. Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You didn't know that, did you?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Now...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"disease-carrying rats?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The second coming of the plague? Does this sound credible to you,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"or perhaps does this sound more like the delusions of a very sick old lady?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I didn't know that.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Her family's furious.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So furious, in fact, they've threatened litigation.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Litigation?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That's crazy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"For once, we agree.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"This is crazy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"In fact, in my entire professional career,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I've never dealt with anything quite like it.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"But hopefully,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"hopefully, you've learned something valuable here.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You've learned...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"how in the workplace,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"in the real world,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"there are consequences to your actions.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Which brings me to my sixth and final...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"fact.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You're fired.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Both of you.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I didn't think it was anything at first.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I mean, I think I just didn't want to believe it.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The first time I felt it was at Day of the Dead.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Power went out that night, too.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And then I felt it again","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"at the field near the Nelson farm the next day.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Will!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What does it feel like?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It's almost like...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You know when you drop on a roller coaster?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Sure.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"No.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It's like...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"everything inside your body","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"is just sinking all at once, but...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"this is worse.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Your body...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"it goes cold and... and you can't breathe.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I've felt it before,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"whenever he was close.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Whenever who was close?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The Mind Flayer.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Go away!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Go away!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I closed the gate.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I know, but...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"what if he never left?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What if we locked him out here with us?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"This is him.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"All of him.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"But, that day on the field,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"a part of him attached itself to me.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"My mom got it out of me...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Get the hell out of my son!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And Eleven closed the gate.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"But the part that was still in me, what if it's still in our world?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"In Hawkins.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I don't understand. The Demodogs died when El closed the gate.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"If the brain dies, the body dies.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We can't take any chances.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We need to assume the worst.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The Mind Flayer's back.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah. And if he is,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"he'd want to attach himself to someone again.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"A new me.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"A new host.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"How can you tell if someone is a host?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey, is he in?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yes, he's busy at the moment, but...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Great.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Excuse me.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You should sit down.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Wouldn't listen...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Uh...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Tony, hold on.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Let me, uh...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I might have to... Let me call you back. Okay.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Thanks.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Jim.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I know, I know.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You're busy. I'm gonna make this fast, I promise.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Is there...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"some kind of problem?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah. You might say that.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The name of a guy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah, I think you might know this guy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Okay.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He was here the other day.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Rides a motorcycle.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Big build, square jaw, dark hair.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He's probably military, maybe ex-military?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Is this ringing... any bells?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Uh...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I don't think so.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Really?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"'Cause it was just two days ago.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"This was right before I saw you.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Oh!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You know what?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Could be the maintenance guy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Maintenance.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah. I can't remember his name.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Oh, God... Uh...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Gary or John or something.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Candice will have his name on file.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We've had trouble with the plumbing. Clogged toilets and...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"sinks with minds of their own.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Excuse me?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"This guy, when I saw him, he was coming out of your office.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Okay, well, I don't remember that.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I shake a lot of hands, you know?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Do you remember when I caught you passed out in the hideaway","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"with all that powder all over your nose?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You remember?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Jim, come on, now.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Do you remember when my boys found you and Candice going at it","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"like a couple of bunnies in the back of your Cadillac?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Do you remember that?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Does your wife remember that?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You, uh...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You really wanna play this game?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Huh?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Not a game, Lar.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Okay.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Those pills you used to swallow like candy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I can't recall, did you have a prescription for those?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Or how about drinking on duty?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We have some real fun stories about that.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"One call to Tom at the Post...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"and you're done, buddy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You're gone.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Oh, and, please,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"don't give me that dead daughter sob story,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"'cause I just don't care.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Now, if you don't mind,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I really am rather busy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Operating directors...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Damn it!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"My nose! You broke my goddamn nose!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And your friend almost killed me last night,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"so I'd say we're still not even.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Larry?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Let's cut the crap, Larry!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Larry!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Who is this guy? Government? Military?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You're making a big mistake.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Who is he?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Larry!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Who you calling? The police?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That is a nice ring you got there, Larry.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Are you insane?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I don't know.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Let's find out.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Okay, okay, okay. Be cool, be cool.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I don't know his name, I swear.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Ah, ah, ah!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"But you know him.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He... He gives me things sometimes.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What kind of things?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Money. Presents. Aah! Gifts.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Who is this guy, Santa Claus?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Starcourt. Starcourt. He works for Starcourt.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The mall?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yes, yes.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah, right.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"They... They own the mall.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"They want to expand to East Hawkins. They needed property, some land.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Some people didn't want to sell, so I leaned on them a little. That's all.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I swear, that's all.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Why do they want this land?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I don't know!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You have records of these purchases, these, uh...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"these land purchases?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You don't want to mess with these people, Jim.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I think you should worry about yourself right now, Larry, not about me.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The records.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Where are they?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Larry?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He just bumped his head.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Have a nice day.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Larry!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It's bullshit.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So, according to Tom, Driscoll's just a schizophrenic?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And that rat is just a rat?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And it's all, what, some big coincidence?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You know what I think?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I think Tom was on drugs.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Did you see him?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He was sweating like crazy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And his palms were clammy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He looked awful.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Oh, is this funny to you?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"No.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"No, it's just kind of incredible.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Incredible?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah, incredible how you just continue to convince yourself.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What's that supposed to mean?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I told you over and over to drop this story.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That it was a bad idea.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"But you refused, and now, I'm screwed.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It's a summer job. Your life is hardly over.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Mortgage, college tuition.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You know, they're real things, Nancy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Things that you don't care about, only because you don't have to.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I didn't realize I lived in a bubble!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Well, you do!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You want everything handed to you on a silver platter.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I mean, we were interns, Nancy!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Interns!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What did you expect, that you would make star reporter in a month?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Crack the big case?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You sound just like them. You realize that, right?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Just like Bruce and those assholes...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Is that what that was? That was humiliating.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Humiliating.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah, the real world sucks.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Deal with it like the rest of us.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You don't know what it's like.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Neither do you.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Well, then, I guess we just don't understand each other anymore.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah, I guess not.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey, you're home early.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"So, this is us, Scoops,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"and this is where we want to get.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I mean, I don't really see a way in.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"There's not,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"if you're talking exclusively about doors.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Air ducts.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Exactly.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"Flashlight.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Thank you.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"Touch my butt! I don't care!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Come on! Harder! Push harder!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I'm pushing!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You're playing with my legs.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I'm not playing, I have terrible footing.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Come on!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I'm gonna just shove you, ready?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Just shove me?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"One, two...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Shit.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"One more time.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Ahoy, sailors! All hands on deck!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Ahoy!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Come on.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Get over here and serve me some samples.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I don't know. He looks pretty normal to me.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Normal? How many times have you seen him with a shirt on?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I mean, it's a little weird.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"More than a little.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He was in a tub with ice. The Mind Flayer likes it cold.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Plus everything else...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"But he's lounging at the pool,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"which is, like, the least Mind Flayer thing ever.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Not necessarily.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The Mind Flayer likes to hide.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He only used me when he needed me.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It's like... like you're dormant.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And then, when he needs you,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"you're activated.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Okay, so we just...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"wait until he gets activated.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"No. What if he hurts someone?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Or kills someone.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We can't take that chance.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We need to find out if he's the host.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Where are you going?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I have an idea. Boys only.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Seriously?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Just trust me on this one.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Okay, so we wait until the pool closes, until everyone leaves,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"and we somehow get him to come from here and...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"get him into here.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey, shut the door!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey, come on, kid, shut it!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I think I just threw up in my mouth.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And look, the controls are right here. It's perfect.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Will it get hot enough?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"220 degrees.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We just have to figure out how to get him in here.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Then we lock him in...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Heat him up...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"No matter what happens, we'll know.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We'll know for sure.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hmm...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah, I don't know.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You don't know if you can fit?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Oh, I can fit. I just don't know if I want to.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Are you claustrophobic?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I don't have phobias.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Okay, well, what's the problem?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The problem is,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I still haven't heard what's in this","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"for Erica.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"More fudge, please.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Go on.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"All right.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You see this? This is the route you're gonna take.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Then we just wait till the last delivery goes out tonight.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Then you knock out the grate, jump down, open the door.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Then you find out what's in those boxes?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Exactly.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Mm-hmm.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And you say this guard is armed.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yes, but he won't be there.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And booby traps?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Booby traps?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Lasers, spikes in the wall?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You know what this half-baked plan of yours sounds like to me?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Child endangerment.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We'll be in radio contact with you the whole time...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Ah, ah, ah!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Child endangerment.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Erica? Hi. Uh...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We think these Russians want to do harm to our country.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Great harm. Don't you love your country?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You can't spell ""America"" without ""Erica.""","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Uh, yeah, yeah.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Oddly, that's, uh, totally true.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So, so, don't do this for us.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Do it for your country.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Do it for your fellow man.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Do this for America... Erica.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Ooh!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I just got the chills.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Oh, yeah, from this float,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"not your speech.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Know what I love most about this country?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Capitalism.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Do you know what capitalism is?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It means this is a free market system.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Which means people get paid for their services,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"depending on how valuable their contributions are.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And it seems to me,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"my ability to fit into that little vent","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"is very, very valuable to you all.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So, you want my help?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"This USS Butterscotch","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"better be the first of many.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And I'm talking free ice cream","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"for life.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Wow, I love the place, Lar.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey, you shoot that fella yourself?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That's... That's not real.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"No shit!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"All right, so...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"what exactly are we looking at?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Land deeds, transfers of property.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So your buddies at Starcourt,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"they suddenly start buying up all this property.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"They tell you why?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I already told you,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"they don't tell me anything.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"They're just using you, I get it.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What I don't get","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"is why you have a bunch of land deeds","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"in a safe in your bedroom.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"These people, Jim,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"they're bad news.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So, what, this is blackmail?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Protection.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Protection.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hold on a second.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey, what is it?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hess Farm, Henry's place,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Bullocks...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Look, they're all here.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"They're all in Southeast Hawkins, right near Jordan Lake.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And what else is near Jordan Lake?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"The power plant.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Four nights ago, there was a huge power outage,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"and the next day...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Your magnets fell.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"would take a massive amount of power to run.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So, what if this machine","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"that we've been talking about really does exist,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"and the reason that we didn't find it at the lab","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"is because it isn't at the lab, it's at one of these properties.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Um...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I want you to... forget about sales.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I want you to come work for me at the Hawkins PD.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And have to look at your face every day? I don't think so.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Larry!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey, where do you think you're going, pal?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Nancy?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Nance?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Maybe Jonathan's right.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I wasn't thinking about anyone, really.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I just...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I wanted to be right.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I wanted to be right so badly.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And were you?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I thought so.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"But maybe I just...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"don't want to admit that I'm wrong,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"because if I'm wrong, then...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You're what everyone thinks you are.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Just a kid who has no idea what she's doing.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It's not easy out there, Nance.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I know.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"People are always saying you can't.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That you shouldn't.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That you're not...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"smart enough, not good enough.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"This world, it...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"it beats you up again and again until eventually, I...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Most people, they just...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"they just stop trying.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"But you're not like that.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You're a fighter.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You always have been.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I honestly don't know where you get it from.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Dad.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I think you were swapped in the hospital, to tell you the truth.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"No.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I get it from you, Mom.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I get it from you.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Well, wherever you get it from,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I'm proud of you.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Proud of me for getting fired?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That you stood up for yourself.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That you stood up to those...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"shitheads.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Mom!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yes, those shitheads.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And if you believe in this story...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Look at me, Nancy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Finish it.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Then go sell it to The Indianapolis Star or whatever and...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I mean, can you imagine their faces","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"when they read a story about their own town","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"in a big paper like that?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That would be...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"pretty amazing.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"So, why not?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Why not?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Finish it.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Uh, Will?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Um, you know, about yesterday...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It's fine, Lucas.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You don't have to say anything.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I know, but it's just...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"It was a really cool campaign.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"And Mike and I, we should've never...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I don't care anymore, Lucas.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I really don't.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"We have bigger things to worry about now.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"This should hold him.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey, I found the breakers.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Whoa, that thing is super creepy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Let me see it.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I think this'll work. Right, buddy?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Right, Mike.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hey, El...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I just wanted to say...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"You know when I said Nana was sick?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"She wasn't. I lied.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I know.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Right, right, right. No, I just...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"think it was important for you to know the context.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hopper, he went all crazy on me,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"telling me I'm spending way too much time with you.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He made me lie. I mean,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"you're the most important thing to me in the world.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What if he's right?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Hop.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"No, no, no, no.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"He's just some angry old man who hates joy.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"But if I only see you,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"and I'm a different species than you,","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"then I should be with my species more.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"What are you talking about?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Did you spy on me?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"That's totally against the rules.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I make my own rules.","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Mike, are you there?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Yeah!","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"Where are you guys?","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA
"I'm coming. Just...","Chapter Four The Sauna Test","3","4",NA

"That man in there,","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"I know he doesn't look it,","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA

"He's, uh...","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"murdered many children.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"What?","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Yeah, he's a true psychopath. I tracked him over two state lines.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Hey, what's going on?","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Ah, Detective Byers.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Uh...","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"this is Todd.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"He's agreed to... lend us his vehicle to transport our dangerous criminal.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA

"I mean, you have to admit, as a feat of engineering alone,","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"this is impressive.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"What are you talking about? It's a total fire hazard.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"There's no stairs, there's no exit,","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA

"They're Commies.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"You don't pay people, they cut corners.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"To be fair to our Russian comrades,","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"I don't think this tunnel was designed for walking.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA

"And then they load it up onto those trucks and nobody's the wiser.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"You think they built this whole mall","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"so they could transport that green poison?","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"I very seriously doubt it's something as boring as poison.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"It's gotta be much more valuable, like promethium or something.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"What the hell is promethium?","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA

"No, no, no. No, don't lump me in with them.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA

"Promethium.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure, but whatever. All I'm saying is,","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"it's probably being used to make something.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Or power something.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Like a nuclear weapon?","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Totally.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Walking towards a nuclear weapon. That's great.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"That'd be great.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA

"About...","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"They could.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"So it's connected?","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"Maybe.","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA
"How?","Chapter Five The Flayed","3","5",NA

"No, I...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Yes, from The Hawkins Post.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Yes, yes, um...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I was just... following up to see if anything else had gone missing,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Um, sorry to bother...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"It doesn't make sense.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"What part of any of this makes sense?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"There's a pattern, okay? A consistency to their behavior.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"They've been feeding on these chemicals since this started,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"and... and, what, they just stop, out of the blue?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Maybe they have all the chemicals they need.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Maybe they've all turned into those... things.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"But what about the source?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I mean, did the Mind Flayer just suddenly stop infecting people?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"And even if the flayed are monsters now, why can't El find them?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Okay, can you guys settle an argument for us?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Who do you think should decide El's limits?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Mike or Eleven?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"The way that you frame that is such bullshit.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"It's not bullshit, Mike. This is your whole problem.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"And it's also precisely the reason why she dumped your ass.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"El dumped you?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Yeah, because she is conspiring against me.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"She's corrupting her.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"No, enlightening her.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"The fact is, she's not yours.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"She's her own person, fully capable of making her own decisions.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"She's risking her life for no reason.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"For no reason?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Mike, the flayed are out there doing God knows what.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Killing, flaying...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Transforming into monsters.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"She knows her abilities better than any of us.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Exactly, thank you.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Wait, what?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Oh, she didn't tell you this?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"No.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Your girlfriend used El's powers","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"to spy on us.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"No, no, no, I did not make her.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"It was her idea.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"And why are we even talking about this, seriously?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Yeah, who cares?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I care.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"We were just joking around.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was taking a massive shit or something?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"You weren't.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"But what if I was?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Then gross!","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Seriously, Mike?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I'm just trying to demonstrate how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"In fact, how careless all of you are.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"You're treating her like some kind of machine when she's not a machine,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"and I don't want her to die looking for the flayed","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"when they've obviously vanished off the face of the Earth.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"So can we please just come up with a new plan","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"What's going on?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Nothing. Nothing.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Just a family discussion.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Oh.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I found him.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Found who?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"He calls it the key, and this key emits a great energy.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"It requires much strength, power.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Those houses, like the one you found,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"they're located near, uh, transformers.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"They're stealing from your town's power grid.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Why build this key here? Why are they not doing this in their own backyard?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"What are they trying to do, blow us to smithereens?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"There were many of these, uh, keys before in Russia,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"but they turned out wrong.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"They had to come to where the... where the, uh...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Where the what?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I don't understand what he's saying.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I thought you were fluent.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Oh, I'm sorry.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Are my free translation services not good enough for you?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"right up my ass!","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"What is Smirnoff doing?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"He's showing me.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Oh, okay.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Uh, he says the straw,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"they're using it to penetrate a hole","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"in... a box?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Okay, sorry, sorry.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"The straw represents the key, which emits a great energy.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"They're using this energy...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"to break through a barrier,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"to open...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"a doorway.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"A doorway between worlds.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Location... Location was the other half.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Oh, what...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"In Hawkins, this door had been opened once.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"It was still...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"healing.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Jesus Christ.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"So, this door is open now?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"He says it is...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"opening.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Where are you going?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"To call our children.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Can we watch Looney Tunes now?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Nyet.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Can I help you with something?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Whiskey.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"You have whiskey?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"No, but I do have vodka.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Oh!","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Right.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Right?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Yeah, okay.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"And do you see those scissors?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Uh-huh.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Yeah, well, I think that if we move at the same time, we could get over there,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"and then maybe I could kick the table and knock them into your lap.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Of course you don't.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"You were a real asshole, you know that?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Yeah, I know.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"But it didn't even matter.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"It didn't matter that you were an ass.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I was still...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"I feel like my whole life has been...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"one big error.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Yep.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Yeah?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Really, I do.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Maybe you could've helped me pass the class.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Maybe instead of being here, I'd be on my way to college right now.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"And I would have no idea","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"that there were evil Russians beneath our feet,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"and I would be happily slinging ice cream with some other schmuck.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Gotta say, though,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I liked being your schmuck.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"It will help you talk.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Did you even clean that thing?!","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"What's he doing now?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"And that's not normal, right?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Billy staying in his room on the Fourth of July?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"No, that's not normal.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"He wants us to find him.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"If we go to Billy, then the rest of the flayed know where we are.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"We won't be surprised.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"We'll know that they're coming, and we will kick their flayed butts.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"You mean El will kick their butts.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Yeah, and unnecessary.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Killing the flayed won't stop the Mind Flayer.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"We have to find out where it's spreading from.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"We have to find the source.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Billy knows it.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Billy's been there.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"To the source.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Yeah, but...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"It's a trap. I know.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"We can't go to Billy,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"but I think there's another way.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"A way for me to see where he's been.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"El, I know you think you have to do this, but you don't.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"It's just, you've only done this before once.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"And your mom, she loved you,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"and wanted you to know what happened.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"And Billy's mind is... is sick, diseased.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"The Mind Flayer is in him.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"He can't hurt me.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Not in there.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Can you hear me?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I want to see.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I want to see what happened.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Something's wrong.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Stop! No! No! No!","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"No!","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"El, are you okay?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Are you okay?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I'm okay.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"What's going on?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"I'm... on a beach.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"Okay, I may be dense,","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"What else do you see?","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"A woman.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"She's...","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"pretty.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Yeah!","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA
"You did it!","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"a boy.","Chapter Six E Pluribus Unum","3","6",NA

"Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me!","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA

"but, admit it, you're real curious to know what he's like in the sack.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"And you. Ha!","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Well, you're just a big manbaby","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"who'd rather act tough than show his true feelings,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"because the last time you opened your heart, you got hurt.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA

"Oh, my God, you have to listen. I know I've been MIA,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad. I mean, I actually was mad,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"but it's also because I was trapped underground","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"in a secret Russian base.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA

"Why would I have batteries?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I always carry batteries.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Then what's the problem?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I need eight.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA

"Plan B? What's plan B?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Where... are they?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA

"So, the future is actually the present,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"which is his time.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Wh... What?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"No, no, it's my turn. You've had enough.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA

"I'm sorry about him, by the way.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Who, Larry?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"No, Murray.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA

"How do you even drink that?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Because it's delicious.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"What?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It's like Carpenter's The Thing.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"The original is a classic,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"no question about it.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"But the remake...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Sweeter, bolder...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"better.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"You're insane.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"So, you prefer the original Thing?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing, I'm talking about New Coke.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It's the same concept, dude.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It is the same concept.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"No, it's not.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Yes, it is.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Hey.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Sorry.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Sorry.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Did you... find him?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"The movies?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Dustin's so freaked out about the gate, he decides to go watch a movie?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Yeah, makes total sense.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"You're positive he said ""gate"" and not ""great""?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Yeah, like, ""This movie I'm watching is great.""","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Sounded like ""gate.""","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Which would explain how the Mind Flayer's still alive.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Yeah, we just have to shut it again.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Then the monster dies.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"But if not, we always have Lucas' fireworks.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Keep mocking my plan, Max. Keep mocking it.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I wanna hear you say it again, because you keep doubting me.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"You keep doubting me!","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Ridiculous.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Will?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"The ceiling stopped spinning for me.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Is it still spinning for you?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Holy shit.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"No.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"You think we puked it all up?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Maybe. Ask me something.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Interrogate me.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Okay. Interrogate you. Sure.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Um...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Today.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"What?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Oh, my God.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It was just a little bit, though.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Oh...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"All right, my turn.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Okay.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Hit me.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Have you...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"ever been in love?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Yep. Nancy Wheeler.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"First semester, senior year.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Oh, my God.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"She's such a priss.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Hm.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Turns out, not really.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Are you still in love with Nancy?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"No.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Why not?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I think it's because I found someone who's a little bit better for me.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It's crazy.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Ever since Dustin got home, he's been saying,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"""You know, you gotta find your Suzie. You gotta find your Suzie.""","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Wait, who's Suzie?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure she's even real.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"But that's not... that's not really the point.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"That doesn't matter. The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"it's somebody that I... didn't even talk to in school.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"And I don't even know why.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Maybe 'cause Tommy H. would've made fun of me or...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I wouldn't be...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"prom king.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right, it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Because, when I think about it,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I should've been hanging out with this girl the whole time.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"First of all, she's hilarious. She's so funny.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"than I have laughed...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"in a really long time.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"And she's smart.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Way smarter than me.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"You know? She's honestly unlike anyone I've ever even met before.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Robin?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Robin, did you just OD in there?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"No.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"am still alive.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"The floor's disgusting.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"What do you think?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"About?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"This girl.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"She sounds awesome.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"She is awesome. And what about the guy?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I think he's on drugs, and he's not thinking straight.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking a lot more clearly than usual.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"He's not.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Look...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"he doesn't even know this girl.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"And if he did know her,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"like... like really know her,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I don't think he'd even want to be her friend.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"No, that's not true. No way is that true.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Listen to me, Steve.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It's shocked me to my core,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"but I like you.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I really like you.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"But I'm not like your other friends.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Robin, that's exactly why I like you.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Do you remember what I said about Click's class?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"About me being jealous and, like, obsessed?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It isn't because I had a crush on you.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"It's because...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"she wouldn't stop staring at you.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Mrs. Click?","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Tammy Thompson.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I wanted her to look at me.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"But... she couldn't pull her eyes away from you","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"and your stupid hair.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"And I didn't understand, because you would get","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"bagel crumbs all over the floor.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"And you asked dumb questions.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"And you were a douchebag.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"And... And you didn't even like her and...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I would go home...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"and just scream into my pillow.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"But Tammy Thompson's a girl.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA

"Okay.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I mean, yeah.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"Tammy Thompson, you know, she's cute and all, but...","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"I mean,","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA
"she's a total dud.","Chapter Seven The Bite","3","7",NA

"The Mind Flayer, it built this monster in Hawkins,","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"to stop El, to kill her and pave a way into our world.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"And it almost did. That was just one tiny piece of it.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"How big is this thing?","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"It's big.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Thirty feet, at least.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA

"this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El,","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Yes.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA

"Are we sure this thing is still out there, still alive?","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"El beat the shit out of it, but, yeah, it's still alive.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"But if we close the gate again...","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"We cut the brain off from the body.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"And kill it.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Theoretically.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Yoo-hoo!","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Yoo-hoo!","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Okay, this is what Alexei called ""the hub.""","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA

"Okay, where's the gate?","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Right here. I don't know the scale on this,","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"but I think it's fairly close to the vault room,","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"maybe 50 feet or so.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"More like 500.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA

"And with all due respect, you do what this man tells you,","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"you're all gonna die.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old speaking to me?","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard!","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Erica!","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Just the facts!","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"She's right. You're all gonna die, but you don't have to. Excuse me.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Sorry, may I?","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Please.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Okay, see this room here? This is a storage facility.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"There's a hatch in here that feeds into their underground ventilation system.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"That will lead you to the base of the weapon.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA

"It's not that simple.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"The signal won't reach.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Not with this. You need something with a high enough frequency band","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"to relay with the Russians' radio tower.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"But for that to work, you need someone who has both seen their comms room","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"and has access to a super-powered handcrafted radio tower,","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"one preferably already situated at the highest point in Hawkins.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA

"That's me.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"If you want us to navigate, you got us.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"But we need a head start.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"And a car.","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA
"Oh, man, now this...","Chapter Eight The Battle of Starcourt","3","8",NA

"We're in the Forest Hills trailer park in east Roane County.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"We don't have a lot of details now, but we can confirm","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"that the body of a Hawkins High student was discovered early this morning.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Police have not released the name…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Holy shit.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"…although we are told they're currently in the process of notifying the family.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"You all right in there, Sinclair?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I'm good.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"First hangover feels like you're gonna split in two,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"but you'll live.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"…occurred here is sure to touch a nerve across the community of Hawkins,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"which is still reeling from last year's devastating mall fire.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Over 30 innocent…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"…completely blocked off at…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Come on.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Just hit it, man.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Yo, just hit it.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Yeah.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"But whatever has occurred…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Piece of shit.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"There you go. See?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"…Is newly appointed police chief Calvin Powell,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"who served as deputy under Chief Hopper.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"What's this? I thought we were watching ThunderCats.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Hawkins student got murdered.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"What?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Yeah, it's on every channel.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"As you can see behind me, Chief Powell and the Hawkins Police Department","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"are actively investigating the scene…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"They say who it is?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"No, not yet.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Hey, maybe Chrissy didn't stand you up after all.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Hey, don't say that.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Relax, it was a joke.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"A joke? Come on, someone just died and you're making a joke out of it?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"It was at the trailer park,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"so probably some druggy OD'd on heroin or some shit.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Oh, see, that makes it funnier.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"What is up your ass this morning? It was a joke.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"We also don't yet know if foul play was involved.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"But whatever has occurred here","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"is sure to touch a nerve across Hawkins.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Ever since that girl, Barb, died a few years ago,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"it has been one thing after another.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I'll tell ya, you start to believe all those things they say,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"that this town is cursed,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"that the devil lives here in Hawkins.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Nancy!","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I don't think anyone's gonna care about the basketball game anymore.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Nancy?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Earth to Nancy.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"What?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I said I don't think anyone's gonna care about the game.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Yeah. No, I know.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Would you be up for a field trip?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Many of the residents we spoke to voiced similar concerns to us.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Grief, shock, disbelief, anger.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Everyone wants to know the same thing,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"how can so many tragedies befall a once-peaceful town?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"All eyes are now on the police for answers.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Is the new chief of police, Powell, in over his head?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Or is he the very savior this town needs?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"We'll be here the rest of the day right here on channel nine,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"where we'll keep you posted on all the latest developments.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA

"This is Beverly Moss, signing off for…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"My heart can't take it anymore. It just can't take it.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Chrissy Cunningham?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"You're sure it was Chrissy?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Yes, in her cheerleader outfit. Same thing she was in when I saw her with Eddie.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Did you tell all this to the cops?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"No.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"No, but I… I can't be the only one who saw them together.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"They stood out.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Eddie the freak with Chrissy the cheerleader?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Exactly. You know, his name's not in the news yet or anything,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"but I guarantee you Eddie is suspect one now.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"That's crazy.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Eddie didn't do this. No way.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"No way.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"We can't rule it out.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Yes, we can.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Dustin!","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"You don't know him like I do, Max.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Okay?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"When we got to high school, Lucas made all his sports friends.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Mike and me?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I mean, no one was nice to us.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"No one except Eddie.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Okay. Well, they said the same shit about Ted Bundy.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Yeah, he's a super nice guy,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"but then he's murdering women on the weekend.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"So you're saying Eddie is like Ted Bundy?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"No, I'm not saying... I'm saying that we can't presume anything, okay?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"But it doesn't look good for Eddie.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Why haven't you told the cops this?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I… I don't know.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"You don't know?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"After I saw Eddie and Chrissy go in the trailer…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"…something else happened.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Okay, all right. Last one.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Come on.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Nothing that weird or anything. I mean…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Eddie always drives like a maniac,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"and the power goes off at my place all the time. It's a piece of shit. But…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"This morning, I started to think back, and…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I don't know.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"The look on his face.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"He was scared, Dustin.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Really scared.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Maybe he was scared because,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"you know, he… he just killed someone, or…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Maybe, um…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Maybe be... because…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I don't… I don't know, maybe…","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Something else killed her.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"But that's impossible.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Right?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I don't know.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"It should be.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Only one person knows what actually happened.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Eddie.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Have you talked to anyone else?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"No.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"I can't find Lucas or Nancy, and Mike's in...","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"California. Shit, shit, shit.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Where you going?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"To see a friend.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA

"What, so I just tell her the truth?","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Yes.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"No. No.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"Because… Because if I told her the truth,","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"then she'd just throw her dreams out the window","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA
"to come out here and be with me. And I… I just can't take that.","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA

"No, man!","Vecnas Curse","4","2",NA

"Pretty straightforward.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Oh, straightforward, really?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"What's confusing to you?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"So far, everyone Vecna has cursed has died,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"except for this old Victor Creel dude Nancy found.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"He's the only known survivor.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"If anyone knows how to beat this curse, it's him.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"That's assuming he was cursed, which we don't even know.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"How can Vecna have existed in the '50s? It doesn't make sense.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Far as we know, Eleven didn't create the Upside Down.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"She opened a gate to it.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"Okay.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"But if a gate didn't exist in the '50s, how did Vecna get through?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"How's he getting through now?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And why now?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And why then? Just pops out in the '50s,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"kills one family, and he's like, ""I'm good.""","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And poof, he just disappears. Just… gone?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Only to return 30 years later and start killing random teens?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"No, I don't buy it.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Straightforward, my ass.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Honestly, Henderson, a little humility now and then, it wouldn't hurt you.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Sorry.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Any idea what she's writing?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Did she sleep?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I mean,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"would you?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Okay, so…","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"…we have a plan.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Thanks to Nancy's minions,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"To which they said no.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"But we landed a three o'clock with the director.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Now all we have to do is charm him and convince him to let us talk to Victor.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Then maybe we can rid Max of this curse.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"About that.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"We've been doing our Victor Creel homework, and, uh…","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"…we got some questions.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Lots of questions.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"So do we. Hopefully, Victor has the answers.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Wait… Wait… Wait a second. Uh…","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Where's mine?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Nancy, you're outta your mind if you think I'm babysitting again.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"First, they're not babies anymore. And Max is in real danger.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"She needs people around her.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I know. But why me?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Oh my God, you have a Tom Cruise poster.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"You have a Tom Cruise poster.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"That's old.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"Can you please not touch anything?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I can't do anything here, Nance.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Maybe I can be helpful with this asylum director dude.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"Not the charm we need.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Ouch.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"No, I just…","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I did a little digging last night, and it turns out this Dr. Hatch","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"is a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"and a Harvard visiting scholar, okay?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"This is a lifelong student of the world. If we're gonna win him over,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"we're gonna have to convince him we are too.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"That, like him…","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"…we are true academic scholars.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Holy shit. There's a little ballerina in here.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Academic scholar? She's giving you an academic scholar vibe? Yeah.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"No, but…","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"…she will.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Oh, please, tell me you're joking.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"It's busy. It's still busy.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"Where are you going?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"You're not under arrest.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Right.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"No, no, you're… you're here to protect us.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"If this goes on for a month, or months, and people can't get a hold of us,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"If you keep staring at that, it's not gonna change. You know?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Yeah. Yeah, you're right.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Before the cops came,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"me and El, we… we had a bad fight.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"We never fight.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I mean, we fought before,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"but just, like, silly fights, stupid fights.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"But, I don't know, this one just felt more adult.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Like, it… it just felt more real.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Like, a fight you can't come back from.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Maybe I should've said something, and if I would've said that thing,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"then maybe she'd want me there with her, wherever she is.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"No. Look, Mike,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"you're gonna see her again,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"and whatever you didn't say, you can say it to her then.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Okay?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"No!","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"Either take me where I need to go or tie me down,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"Yeah, I know Larry. Quite well, actually.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Eh, you know what they say.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"""Those who can't do, teach.""","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Uh, yes, yes, that's actually why we're here.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I mean, we can only learn so much in a classroom.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Mmm.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And I'm sympathetic to your struggle, truly.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"But there is a protocol to visiting a patient like Victor.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"You put in a request","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"and then undergo a screening process,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"at which point the board will make a decision.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I can see you're disappointed.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"But I'm more than happy to give you a tour.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Perhaps you can even speak to some patients in our low-security wing.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And we'd… we would love that.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"It's just that, um…","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"…our thesis is due next month.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And you're out of time.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Whose fault is that?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Ours. Absolutely.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And I do apologize...","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Don't apologize, Ruth. Screw that.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"The fact is, we did put in a request months ago and were denied.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And then we reapplied and were denied again.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And coming here was our last-ditch effort to save our thesis.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And I really… I can't breathe in this thing.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Well, Rose, maybe you'd like to go outside and get some air.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Maybe I should, Ruth.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Mm-hmm.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Because I'm starting to think this whole thing is a colossal mistake.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I'm breaking out in a rash.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"My boobs hurt. And I'll tell you the truth, Anthony.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"May I call you Anthony? These aren't my clothes.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I borrowed them because I wanted you to take us seriously.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Because nobody takes girls seriously in this field. They just don't.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"We don't look the part or whatever. But can I tell you a story?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"1978, I was at summer camp.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And my counselor Drew told me and everyone in Cabin C","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"the true story of the Victor Creel Massacre.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And little Petey McHew… You know Petey, right, Ruth?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Of… Of course.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Yeah. Little Petey McHew started sobbing right there on the spot.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Full-on hyperventilating.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"The other campers couldn't sleep for weeks.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I couldn't either, but not 'cause I was scared.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Because I was obsessed with the question,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"""What would drive a human being to commit such unimaginable acts?""","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Other kids wanted to be astronauts, basketball players, rock stars.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"But I wanted to be you.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I wanted to be you.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"So, forgive me if I'll now try anything in my power,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"including wearing this ridiculous outfit,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"if I might get to speak to the man that ignited my passion","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"and learn a little more about how his twisted, but let's face it,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"totally fascinating mind works.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"So, yes, we don't have the official paperwork,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"but don't tell me that cry-baby Petey McHew","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"wouldn't have gotten an audience with Victor in moments","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"if he'd asked politely,","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"because you and I both know that he would.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"So… ten minutes with Victor.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"That's all I ask.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"I'm back in 30.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Mm-hmm.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"What?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"You see damage to this hull?","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Yuri was on sightseeing trip to see polar bears.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And then bears got into plane","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"and pull him out of cockpit and kill Yuri.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"No.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"Yeah.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"And he loved bears.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA
"They broke his heart.","Dear Billy","4","4",NA

"that this was the only way.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But I don't see any progress out there, Martin.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You know what I see?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I see a frightened, traumatized little girl.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Good for us.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The truth is, you're regressing, Eleven.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You're going backwards.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Eleven, look at me.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Look at me.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I know you're frightened.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You're terribly frightened by what you've seen.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But it's this very fear that's now holding you back.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"If you want Nina to succeed,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"you cannot hide from the truth, no matter how frightening it may be.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I saw what I did.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I am a monster.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You speak of monsters,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"superheroes.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That's the stuff of myth and fairy tales.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Reality, truth, is rarely so simple.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"People are not so easily defined.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Only by facing all of ourselves, the good and the bad,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"can we become whole.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What if I don't wanna become whole?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Then that is a choice.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Your choice.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The door is always open.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"This place","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"is not a prison.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"This is.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You chose to trust me once.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I'm asking you to trust me again.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Journey with me into the past one last time.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Stop hiding, Eleven.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What have you done?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"How much time did you skip?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You wanted progress.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I'm giving it to you.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What exactly were you all doing at the lake?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Uh…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It's comp...","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We were… We were just going for a walk.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"A walk?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"At 9:00 p.m.?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"To the lake.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We were gonna","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"take a little swim.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Little night swim.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Dusty.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Someone was just murdered there.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah, we… we didn't realize that until we got there.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That's why we didn't swim.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"And Nancy, was she with you at this night swim?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yes. Uh…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We're not sure.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"She was there.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Then she left.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It's all a little confusing.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That's when you guys came.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Right. Then they dared me to say what I said.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Oh, yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"About the killer.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You're lucky you didn't get shot.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Have you had any contact with Eddie?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That psycho… freak killer?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"God, no.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nope. Absolutely not.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No. We haven't heard from him.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We barely know the guy.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Who?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Oh, that's a bunch of bull.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Erica!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I mean, you realize they're lying.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The whole couch is on fire.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Erica.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Just the facts.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Are you lying to these policemen, Dusty?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Lying to cops is a crime, son.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I'm not lying.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The fire is consuming us.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Threaten them with a little jail time. Maybe that'll loosen their lips.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Okay...","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You wanna send our kids to jail?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We need to take this seriously.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"He didn't mean it like that.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Shut up!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Oh my God.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Shut up!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Jesus.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Shh.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We're gonna try a more civilized approach.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"One at a time.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You first.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Wait, what? Why me?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Follow me.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I'm not even in Hellfire.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Do I need to cuff you?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Up.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Chop-chop.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Let's go.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Oh… okay.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That was close.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Too close.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Oh, sh… shit.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Steve?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Jesus.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I'm fine. I'm fine.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No, no, no. You're not. You're losing blood.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Come on, sit. All right?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"All right.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Oh…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Okay.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So the good news is I'm pretty sure wooziness is not a symptom of rabies.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But if you start having hallucinations or muscle spasms","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"or you start feeling aggressive, like you wanna punch me, let me know.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Robin.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I kinda wanna punch you.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Sense of humor's still intact. That's a good sign.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Okay.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Okay.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You ready?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Just do it.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Sorry.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It's okay.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Too tight?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No, that's good.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"All right.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Okay.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Thanks.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So, uh,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"this place is like Hawkins, but with monsters and nasty shit?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Pretty much.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Wait, watch out for the vines.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It's all a hive mind.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It's all a what?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"All the creepy crawlies around here.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"They're, like, one or something.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Step on a vine, you're stepping on a bat, you're stepping on Vecna.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Shit.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But everything from our world is still here, right? Except people?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"As far as I understand it, yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So, theoretically, we could go to the police station","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"and steal guns and grenades and whatever we need","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"to blow up those bat things that are guarding the gate.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I highly doubt the Hawkins PD has grenades, Robin.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But guns, yeah, sure.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Well, we don't have to go all the way downtown for guns.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I have guns in my bedroom.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nancy Wheeler,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"have guns, plural,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"in your bedroom?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Full of surprises, isn't she?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"A Russian Makarov and a revolver.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah, you almost shot me with that one.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You almost deserved it.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"For your modesty, dude.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Oh my god!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So guns seem like a pretty good idea to me.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah, me too.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So what are we waiting for?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You know,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"what we are to attempt is quite mad.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Even by your standards, American.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You got odds for us this time?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I think…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"A thousand to one?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Even if we somehow kill this beast, we still must escape.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We fail there,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I don't think they will be so kind as to throw us back in a cell.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"They will shoot us on sight.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We'd die as monster slayers.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You'll be a legend.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But still a traitor. You forgot traitor.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Monster slayer trumps traitor.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I bet Mikhail will be proud of his pops, at least.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Mikhail?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Mmm.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I can't do nothing right with him anymore, it seems.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"He will say,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"""Papa, I bet that bald American did most of the monster slaying.""","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"He's that age, huh?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah, he is that age.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It is same for you, American?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"With your new daughter?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The last time I was with El, she wanted just about nothing to do with me.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I was just in her way, really.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I think back to the way I was with my dad at that age. I was the same way.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The exact same way.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I think it must be hardwired into us to reject our fathers.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So we can grow and move on.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Become something of our own.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I hope that's what she's doing.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Coming into her own.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But still...","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You worry.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"To worry for our sons and daughters,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"that is natural, isn't it?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But nothing about what El has had to deal with is natural.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That beast,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"that monster in there,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"it's a part of something that wants to hurt El. To kill her.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I don't understand.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"To be honest, neither do I.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"All I know is that thing…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That thing shouldn't be here. It shouldn't be alive.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Because it is, it means it still isn't over.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I thought I was put here","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"to pay for what I've done.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But I might've been put here for some other reason.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Maybe I…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Maybe I can still help El.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Even if it's the last thing I do.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You almost sound religious, American.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Religious? I don't know about that.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But maybe I should give that prayer thing a try.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"'Cause if we wanna get out of here, get back to El and Mikhail,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"you and me…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We're gonna need a miracle.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Can I help you, comrade?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"My name is Yuri Ismaylov.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Hello.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The warden is expecting me.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I have a very special delivery for him.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"A rare import from America.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Okay, okay. I'm okay.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Try your best not to blink.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Any more headaches?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nausea this morning?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"How about your memory?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Can you remember what happened now?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Perhaps someone else can help fill in the gaps.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yes?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Good morning, children.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Good morning, Papa.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Today's lesson is going to be about rules.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Ah, for some of you,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"this may seem redundant.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"For others, it appears a refresher is required.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Eleven, please step forward.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Last night, your sister Eleven suffered a concussion","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"during her alone time in the rainbow room.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Now, she claims to not have a memory of what happened.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But injuries of this nature don't simply happen.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Someone did this.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Someone in this room.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Now,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"who's going to tell me what happened?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"She must've… fallen.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Fallen?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You've seen her, Papa.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"She's clumsy.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Stupid.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Eleven, you may step back.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Number Two, please step forward.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Collar him.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Thank you.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You think because you demonstrate some talent","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"that you're somehow immune to the rules, is that it?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No, Papa.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That the rules don't apply to you in the same way","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"that they apply to your brothers and sisters?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No, Papa.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Then why did you attack Eleven?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Did she tell you that?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Are you asking the questions or am I?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Did you attack Eleven?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"If she told you that, then… then she's lying.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Papa, please, you have to believe me.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Papa, please.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"She's lying...","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Now,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"shall we try again?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What happened?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It was an accident.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Couldn't we have tried a road, or something just slightly less creepy?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I think we're getting close. We're almost out of here. Don't worry.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Eddie.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Eddie. Hey, man. Uh…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Listen, I just, uh…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I just want to say thanks.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"For saving my ass back there.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Shit. You saved your own ass, man.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I mean, that was a real Ozzy move you pulled back there.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Ozzy?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"When you took a bite out of that bat.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Ozzy Osbourne?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Black Sabbath?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"He bit a bat's head off onstage.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I don't...","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You know? Doesn't matter.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It's very metal, what you did. That's all I'm saying.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Thanks.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Henderson told me you were a badass. Insisted on the matter, in fact.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Henderson said that?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Oh yeah. Shit.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Kid worships you, dude.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Like, you have no idea. It's kinda annoying, to be honest.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I don't even know why I care what that little shrimp thinks,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"but, uh, guess I got a little jealous, Steve.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I guess I couldn't accept the fact that Steve Harrington","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"was actually","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"a good dude.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Rich parents, popular, chicks love him. Not a douche?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No way, man. No way. That, like,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"flies in the face of all the laws in the universe","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"and my own personal Munson doctrine.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Still super jealous as hell, by the way.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Which is why I would never have jumped in that lake to save your ass.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Not under any, uh… normal circumstances.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nope.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Outside of D&amp;D, I am no hero.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I see danger and I just turn heel and run.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Or at least that's what I've learned about myself this week.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Give yourself a break, man.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"See?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The only reason I came in here was 'cause those ladies","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"came in straight after you.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Now, I was too ashamed to be the one who stayed behind.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But Wheeler right there,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"she didn't waste a second.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Not one second.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"She just dove right in.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Now, I don't know what happened between you two,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"but if I were you,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I would get her back.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"'Cause that","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"was as unambiguous a sign of true love","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"as these cynical eyes have ever seen.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Goddamn it!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Here we go again.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Second on my list of least favorite things, earthquakes.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Seriously, I'm unsteady enough as it is.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nancy!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Where are you going?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nancy!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nancy!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Come on.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Steve, do you copy?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nancy? Robin?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"This is Dustin. Where are you?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We've been collared by the law. I repeat, we've been collared by the law.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Do you copy?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Shit!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Should we get lawyers?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We're not ready for that.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"As far as we know, nobody did anything wrong.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But what if they did do something wrong?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Anything?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nothing.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You don't think they went through…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Through Watergate?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Without us? Without a plan? Without weapons?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"The serial killer is a dark wizard from the Upside Down.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"And we've been looking for him,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"At least we thought we couldn't,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"until we found a gate at Lover's Lake.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That was the reason why we were there, but these stupid cops grabbed us.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"And if you tell anyone about this,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"that's including Mom","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"and Dad","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"and Tina…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"…especially Tina,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Will smother you","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"The smothering in my sleep part, but not much else.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Why would they open up a gate at Lover's Lake?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The commies.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The commies didn't.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Then who did?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nobody.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Erica, you have no idea what you're talking about.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No, she doesn't, yet she raises an essential question.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"How did Watergate open up?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Only two gates have opened, so far as we know.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"One by El, one by the commies.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But it's not the commies or El this time, so it…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Holy shit.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Wait, wait, wait, wait.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"""Wait, wait, wait,"" what?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"There's one thing we've never understood.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Which is why Vecna's killing people.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What's his motive?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Killing teens? It always just seemed too random.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Too prosaic.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"On top of that, how does the Mind Flayer figure into all this?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Maybe this is it.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"This is the answer.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What is the answer?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You sure you just want water?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We have Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Coke works. Thank you.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Okay, just hear me out.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"How did El open the Mother gate?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"She contacted the Demogorgon.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"With psychic contact. Just like…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Vecna when he casts his spells.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Exactly.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So, what if, with each kill,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"he's not simply killing them,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"he's making a powerful psychic connection with his victims?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"A connection powerful enough","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"to rip a hole in the fabric of time and space.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"He's opening more gates.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Bingo.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Copy. We're still at the Wheeler house.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Why would he be opening gates?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"To take over the world.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Who do we know that wants to take over the world?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The Mind Flayer.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So if the Demogorgon was just his foot soldier,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Vecna's his five-star general.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"A five-star general with the power to open gates.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Holy shit.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Holy shit.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Holy shit. That was incomprehensible.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You lost me at ""Mother gate."" Please be kind. Rewind.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Oh, no. I blocked that out.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So what was that giant laser?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Might be time to get a maid, Wheeler.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Come on. I don't want to stay here longer than we have to.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"I don't understand.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Maybe you left them somewhere else.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"There's a six-year-old in the house. I know where I keep my guns.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"You're not supposed to be here.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No, I gave you to Cousin Joanna two years ago.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What is it?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nancy? You're freaking me out.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I think the reason that my guns aren't here","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Dustin! Dustin! Can you hear me?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That brings us to the question you first raised.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"How and why is there a gate at Lover's Lake?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Let's analyze.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What do Eleven and Vecna have in common?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Dustin!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Dustin?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Dustin!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"All right, either this kid can't hear us or he's being a total douche bag.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Will found a way.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Will.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"He found a way to speak to Joyce through the lights.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Lights?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The switch. Try the switch.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Okay.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It's not working.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Guys?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You seeing this?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"…to open a tear in time and space,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"just like the Mother gate.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Whoa.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"…are these like the Mother gate…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But a gate nonetheless.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Tickles.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It kinda feels good.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Does anyone know Morse code?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"No.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Wait, does SOS count?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Is that…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Is that good?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So our working theory is that Vecna makes remote contact from his attic.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"We don't know why. We assume he can do it from anywhere.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Are you even listening to me?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I'm listening.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It's just…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Yeah, why?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"She was more beautiful in her uniform, but still,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"quite striking, isn't she?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yes, very pleasing to the eyes, comrade.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But not so pleasing to the ears, I am afraid.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Where is he?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What have you done with Hopper, you vile commie pig?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"As I said,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"unpleasant.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But, I must say,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I, too, am curious.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The other American.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What did you do with him?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I don't know why, but I imagine him on a rack,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"in the cold, stretched thin,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Am I... close?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"You are not the Yuri I have heard of.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"You wait for the buzzer.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You wait.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You move before the buzzer...","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"you will be shot.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Yes.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Just keep playing the game if you understand.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Why Papa punished Two today.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"which is…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Why?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You frighten him.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"He knows you are more powerful than the others.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"And he also knows he can't control you.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That's all he wants.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Control.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I saw all this happening.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"That's why I wanted to help you, but I only made things worse.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Helping me…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"I'm going to find us a way out.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Wait.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"How did you...","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Like I said,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"But, uh…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Here goes nothing.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"There we go.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"And if my theory is correct…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Huh. Abracadabra.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Holy shit.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"All right, pull on it! See if it holds!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"This is the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Shit.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"See you on the other side.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"On the other side.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Nancy, wake up.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Wake up! Nancy!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Vecna.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Do you remember what you did, Nancy?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Or have you already forgotten?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"When I kill someone…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"…I never forget.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Nancy!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I asked you to wait.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Why do you cry for them, Eleven?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"After everything they did to you?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Hmm?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You think you need them, but you don't.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You don't.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Oh, but I know you're just scared.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I was scared once too.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I know","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"what it's like","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"to be different.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"To be alone","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"in this world.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I see you've been looking for me, Nancy.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You were so close.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So close to the truth.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"How was old, blind, dumb Victor?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Did he miss me?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I've been meaning to check back in,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"but I've been busy.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"So very busy.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"What'd I tell ya?","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Wow.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"This is amazing.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It looks like a fairy tale.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"A dream.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Alice, no running.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It's so big!","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"This is nice.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Yeah.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Like you,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I didn't fit in with the other children.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Something was wrong with me.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"All the teachers and the doctors said I was…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"""Broken,""","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"My parents","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"thought a change of scenery, a fresh start in Hawkins,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"might just cure me.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"It was absurd.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"As if the world would be any different here.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But then…","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"To my surprise, our new home provided","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"a discovery.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"And a new found sense of purpose.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I found a nest of black widows living inside a vent.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Most people fear spiders.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"And yet,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I found them endlessly fascinating.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"More than that,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I found a great comfort in them.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"A kinship.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Like me,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"they are solitary creatures.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"And deeply misunderstood.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"They","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"are gods of our world.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"The most important of all predators.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"They immobilize and feed on the weak,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"bringing balance and order to an unstable ecosystem.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"But the human world was disrupting this harmony.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"You see,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"humans","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"are a unique type of pest,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"multiplying","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"and poisoning our world,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"all while enforcing a structure of their own.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"A deeply unnatural structure.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Where others saw order, I saw a straitjacket.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"day after day.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I could not do that.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I could not close off my mind","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"and join in the madness.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I could not pretend.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"And I realized","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"I became an explorer.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"A terrible lie.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"They had done things, Eleven.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Such awful things.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I showed them who they really were.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"I held up a mirror.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"My naive father believed","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"But my mother somehow knew.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Knew it was I who was holding up that mirror,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"and she despised me for it.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"She called a doctor, an expert.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"She wanted him to lock me away, to fix me,","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"No choice but to act.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"To break free.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"With each life I took, I grew stronger.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"More powerful.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Dr. Martin Brenner.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA
"Papa.","The Massacre At Hawkins Lab","4","7",NA

"Oh, no, I just have always wanted to visit the Soviet Union.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"With Murray.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You two getting along?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He's the Star sky to my Hutch.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I thought you were dead.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Thought I lost you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA

"For eight months.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We had a funeral.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA

"Are you kidding?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You're the hero of Hawkins.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA

"The hell are they doing?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hey.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Found something.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Think this'll lead us outta here?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I give it a hundred to one odds.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And one, two, three.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And one, two, three.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA

"Eleven. Can you hear us?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No, leave her.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hi, Jane.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Holy shit, dude. Check it out.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I didn't know they expanded into Nevada.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Watch out, Domino's.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Your dominoes are gonna fall.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How far is Nina from Vegas?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"From Vegas?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Um, as long as Suzie's coordinates are right,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"about another 90 miles. Why?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, once we save her, El, we should stop on the way back.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"El could make us, like, super rich, and we'd never have to work.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We could just play D&amp;D and Nintendo for the rest of our lives.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah. Totally.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We're gonna make it, Mike. She's gonna be okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah, I know. I… I know she is.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But… But what if after all this is over, she…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Sh… she doesn't need me anymore?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No, o… of course she'll still need you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She'll always need you, Mike.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I keep telling myself that, but I…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I don't believe it.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I mean, she's special.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She was born special.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Maybe I was one of the first people to realize that.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But the truth is, when I stumbled on her in the woods,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"she just needed someone.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's not fate. It's… It's not destiny. It's just simple dumb luck.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And one day she's gonna realize I'm just some random nerd","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"that got lucky that Superman landed on his doorstep.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I mean, at least Lois Lane","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"is an ace reporter for the Daily Planet, right? But…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Sorry.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No, I… it's so stupid, given everything that's going on.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's just… I… I don't know, I just…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Uh…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You're scared of losing her.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Can I show you something?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"This is amazing.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Did you paint this?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah. Yeah. I mean…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I mean… I mean, El asked me to.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She commissioned it, basically. I mean, she told me what to draw.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Anyway, my point is,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"see how you're leading us here?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You're guiding the whole party, inspiring us.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That… That's what you do.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And see your coat of arms here? It's a heart.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And I know it's sort of on the nose,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"but that's what holds this party together. Heart.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Because, I mean, without heart, we'd all fall apart.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Even El. Especially El.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"These past few months, she's been so lost without you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's just, she's so different from other people, and…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"…when you're… when you're different,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"sometimes…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"…you feel like a mistake.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But you make her feel like she's not a mistake at all.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Like she's better for being different.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And that gives her the courage to fight on.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If she was mean to you","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"or she seemed like she was pushing you away,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"it's because she's scared of losing you, like you're scared of losing her.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And if she was going to lose you,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I… I think she'd rather just get it over with quick.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Like ripping off a Band-Aid.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So, yeah, El needs you, Mike.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And she always will.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"After the attack,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"you fell into a coma.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Like One, you had pushed yourself beyond your limit.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And it very nearly destroyed you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But that is where your similarities ended.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What you displayed that day","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"was beyond anything I'd ever imagined.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"A potential I'd only dreamed of.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But when you awoke,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"something had been lost.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Your memories,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"along with whatever else you'd found within yourself that day.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But I knew then, just as I knew today,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"that your powers had not been lost.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They just needed a spark.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But that day,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"you awakened something else.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"A doorway to another world.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I always thought that Henry was out there,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"hiding in the darkness.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I didn't know for sure, not beyond a feeling.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Until now.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He's claimed three victims so far, and when I saw the eyes,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I knew… I knew that was him.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He was sending us a message, letting us know he's back.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That's when I came to see you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"My friends.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, we… we haven't risked contact,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"but, as far as we know,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"they're… they're all safe.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But I'm not gonna lie to you, Eleven.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Your friends are in terrible danger.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"With each victim he takes,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Henry is…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Chiseling away at the barrier that exists between our two worlds.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"""Chiseling""?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Imagine, if you will,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"the barrier between our worlds is a…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Concrete dam.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Henry is putting cracks in this dam.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Cracks in dams","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"create pressure.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Left unchecked,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"the pressure will build.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And build.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And eventually, it will reach a breaking point.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And the dam will burst.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And when that happens,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hawkins will fall.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, that went very well, I thought.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You eased her into it, nice and gentle, just like we talked about.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Not ominous at all.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He showed me","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"things that haven't happened yet.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"The most awful things.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I saw","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"a dark cloud","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"spreading over Hawkins.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Downtown on fire.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Dead soldiers.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And this…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Giant creature","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"with… a gaping mouth.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And this creature wasn't alone.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"There were so many monsters.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"An army.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And they were coming into Hawkins.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Into our neighborhoods.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Our homes.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And then…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He showed me my mom.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And Holly.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Mike.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And they…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They were all…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay, but… he's just trying to scare you, Nance.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Right? I mean…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I mean, it's not real.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Not yet.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But there… there was something else.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He showed me gates.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Four gates.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Spreading across Hawkins.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And these gates, they looked like the one outside of Eddie's trailer,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"but… they didn't stop growing.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"This was our Hawkins.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Our home.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Four chimes.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Vecna's clock.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It always chimes four times.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Four exactly.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I heard them too.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He's been telling us his plan this whole time.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Four kills.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Four gates.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"End of the world.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If that's true…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He's only one kill away.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Try 'em again. Try 'em again.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Anything?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Rang a few times, then went to busy signal.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Maybe you punched it wrong. Try again.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I didn't punch it in wrong.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, I don't know.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I think she knows how to use a phone.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm just saying, she could've typed it in wrong.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Same shit.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How is that possible?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Joyce has this telemarketer job. Always on the phone.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Mike won't stop whining about it.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah, but this phone's been busy for, what, three days now?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That's not Joyce.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No way. Something's wrong.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She's right.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It can't be just coincidence. It can't be.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Whatever's happening in Lenora is connected to all of this.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm sure of it.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But Vecna can't hurt them.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Not if he's dead.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We have to go back in there. Back to the Upside Down.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Whoa, no, no, no. What?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Nope.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Let's think this through.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What is there to think through?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We barely made it out of there.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah, because we weren't prepared.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But this time, we will be. We'll get weapons and protection.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We'll go through the gate, we'll find his lair, and we'll kill him.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Or he'll kill us.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"The only reason you survived is because he wanted you to.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He's not scared of us.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And for good reason.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Sorry, what are we calling him now?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"One.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Vecna.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Henry.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Right.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We've learned something new about Vecna/Henry/One.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He's a number like Eleven,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"only a sick, evil, male, child-murdering version of her with really bad skin.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But my… my point is, he's super powerful.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Could turn us inside out with a snap of his fingers. It's not a fair fight.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Then why fight fair?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You're right. He's like Eleven. But that gives us an upper hand.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We know Eleven's strengths.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And weaknesses.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Weaknesses?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"When El remote-travels,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"she goes into this sort of trance-like state.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I bet the same is true of Vecna.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That would explain what he was doing in that attic.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Exactly. When he attacks his next victim,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'll bet you he's back in that attic, physical body defenseless.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Defenseless? What about the army of bats?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"True. We'll have to find a way past them.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Distract them somehow.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And, uh, how do we do that, exactly?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No idea.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But once they're gone,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"he doesn't stand a chance.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It'll be like slaying sleeping Dracula in his coffin.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That all sounds good in theory,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"but there is no pattern to Vecna's killings.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Not one that I can decipher.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We don't know when he's going to attack next.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Don't even know who he's going to attack.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah, we do.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I can still feel him.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm still marked.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Cursed.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I ditch Kate Bush,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I draw his focus back to me.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Max.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You can't.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He'll kill you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I survived before.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I can survive again.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I just need to keep him busy long enough so that you guys can get into that attic.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Then you can chop his head off.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Stab him in the heart. Blow him up with some explosive Dustin cooks up.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I honestly don't care how you put this asshole in his grave.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Just…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"…whatever it is…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Whatever you do…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Try not to miss.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Bam.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Durak.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Son of a bitch!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Sayonara!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Oh God! Oh God!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Son of a bitch!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You okay? All right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You okay?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay? I'm great! Whoo!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Oh, nothing like a little prison escape to get your day started, am I right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We're not out of the woods yet.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"My people do not take kindly to escapes. They'll be hunting us.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah, well, we aren't exactly planning on sticking around.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Where's the plane you came in on?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That plane? Um, that crashed.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Crashed?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"His fault.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"A word of warning.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That man is more slippery than an eel dipped in baby oil.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I wouldn't trust a word out of his mouth.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"My tongue. My tongue!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I… I can't feel my tongue.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We need to get out of here, back to the States.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Can you get us to another plane?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Now?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You're asking for Yuri's help","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"after dragging him through miles of shit tunnel?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I could have told you we are going wrong way hours ago.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You Neanderthal...","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Watch your mouth, or I am gonna take this,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm gonna rub it along the bottom of my shoe,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and I'm gonna jam it down your throat.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, go ahead!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But then you'll never make it out of my country alive.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So you can get us out.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"For a glass of water and hot steam bath","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and five-inch stack of American dollars,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yuri will fly you to moon.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You make another demand, you double-crossing mudak,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'll decorate the roof of this van with your brains.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Why so angry, comrade?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Rough couple of days for you, I'm sure.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But now you are free.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Everything works out. Happy ending for everybody.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"For you, that will very much depend on how you answer. Comrade.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Will you take us to America?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yes?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Or no?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Check this out. The War Zone.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I've been there once.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's huge.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They got everything you need for, uh…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, killing things, basically.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You think fake Rambo has enough guns there?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Is that a grenade? I mean, how is any of this legal?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, lucky for us it is, so…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"This… This place is just far enough outside of Hawkins.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"As long as we steer clear of main roads,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"we ought a be able to avoid cops and, uh, angry hicks.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If we're trying to avoid angry hicks,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"maybe we shouldn't go to some store called the War Zone.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Normally, I'd agree, but we need the weapons.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So I think it's worth the risk.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Me too.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But is it worth the time? It'll take all day to bike there and back.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Who said anything about bikes?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You got some car we don't know about?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's not exactly a car, Steve.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And it's not exactly mine,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"but, uh… it'll do.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hey, Red, uh, you got a ski mask or a bandanna, something like that?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That was suffocating.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Go! Come on.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Where'd you learn how to do this?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, when the other dads were teaching their kids how to fish or play ball,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"my old man was teaching me how to hot-wire.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Now, I swore to myself I wouldn't wind up like he did,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"but now I'm wanted for murder,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and soon, grand theft auto.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So, uh, I'm really living up to that Munson name.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Eddie, I'm not sure I love the idea of you driving.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Oh, I'm just starting this sucker. Harrington's got her.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Don't ya, big boy?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What the hell?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hey! Open this door!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hey!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They locked the door!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Shit! Go.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's just a car. Everybody, hang on to something!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Oh my God! Let's go! Let's go!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Drive, Steve! Drive!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Go, go, go!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Shit, they look pissed.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's not every day you lose your house and car in one fell swoop.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hold on! Hold on!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Them!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Stop 'em! God bless it!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"My friends. I saw them. You told me they were safe.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They are not safe.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Uh, just give us a second, please.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Please.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay, okay, first… first things first.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We're not gonna let anything happen to your friends, okay, kiddo?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I will personally make sure of that.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Did… Did you see where they were?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They were at… They were at Max's house.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They're planning to kill him.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"To kill Henry.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay. Okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"This… Does this Max have a last name?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Max… Max Mayfield.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay. So here's what's gonna happen.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I have people in Hawkins, and I'm gonna send some to Max Mayfield.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And they will stop him...","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Her.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Stop her. And the rest of them","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"from whatever foolish, although well-intentioned, mission","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"that they're attempting, alright?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No. No, do not send your men.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Send me.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Your friends are not prepared for this fight, Eleven.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And neither are you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You must understand,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"when One kills, he doesn't simply kill.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He consumes.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He takes everything from his victims.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Everything they are and everything they ever will be.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Their memories, their abilities.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And we do not know where he's been these lost years.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But if he has survived this long,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"we can only assume","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"that he has grown in strength.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"To underestimate him,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"to act rashly,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"would be very dangerous.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I don't want to upset you, Eleven.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What you've accomplished is nothing short of a miracle.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You came to me broken.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And you've learned to walk again.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But if you want to stop One,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"you will need to do more than walk.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You will need to do more than run.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You will need to fly.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And you're not ready.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"My friends need me.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I've stopped him once. I will again.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm sorry. You can't.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's impossible.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Nothing's impossible.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I can call Stinson. She's got connections at Nellis. That's two hours away.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And if we hustle, I'll bet we can be in Hawkins before nightfall.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That would be a grave mistake.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Waiting would be an even greater mistake.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What if One makes his move","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"before we've had a chance to throw a punch?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Then what is the point of all this?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That's a risk we're going to have to take.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We pushed her before and look what happened.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She lifted a 10,000-pound tank into the goddamn air.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You don't understand what he's capable of!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Maybe you're right. Or maybe you are overestimating him.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Either way, doesn't matter because this is not our choice.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We agreed this was not gonna be a prison.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We'll show her what this is,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"what we can offer,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and then it is her choice whether she wants to stay or go.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Right, Doc?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You may not agree with it,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"but here she is, standing before us,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"making a choice.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You're sure you wanna do this?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay. Pack your things, say your goodbyes.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How's it handle?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Not half bad.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Considering that this is a…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"House.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah, it's…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's silly, but I… I've actually…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I always had this dream that I'd have this really… really big family.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm talking, like, uh,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"a full brood of Harringtons.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Like, five, six kids.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Six?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah. Six little nuggets.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Three girls, three boys.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And… and every summer, I figured all of us Harringtons,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"we would pack into something like this","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and… just see the country.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You know, the Rockies, Grand Canyon,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"maybe Yellowstone.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"End up in some beach side town in California.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Spend a week parked in the sand.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Learn how to surf or something.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That sounds nice.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, uh, except for the six-kid part.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That sounds like a total nightmare.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If only I had some practice.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"All right. Fair.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That's fair.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hey.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So I've been thinking,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"two of the three of Vecna's victims were seeing Ms. Kelley, right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So I figure there's a good chance Vecna cursed another one of her students.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We go back to her office. We read all of her files.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Look for mentions of headaches, nosebleeds, nightmares.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We identify his most likely next victim.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Lucas.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We stake out his house...","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Lucas, stop.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We don't have time for any of that, okay?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And even if we did,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"even if your plan did work,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"we'd be putting a total stranger at risk.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"A stranger who has no idea what they're up against.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I do.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He uses my memories against me.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But… only my darkest memories.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Same with Chrissy and Fred, right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Right.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's like he only sees the darkness in us.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So, I'll just run in the opposite direction.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Run to the light.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And maybe he won't be able to find me there.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Now, how exactly do you plan on doing this?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm not sure.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But it's my mind.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Not his, right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So I should be able to control where I am.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I just need to… push him away.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Find a happy memory and hide there.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hide in the light.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You got a memory in mind?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It was a time when I was","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"the happiest.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Was I there?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That's presumptuous of you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But yeah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You might've been there.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay, but the second you start to lift,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm calling in Kate Bush.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"All right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Deal.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Deal.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Heh, come on. This way.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If I get a whiff of any funny business, smuggler...","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I will not hesitate to kill you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"In fact... I am just looking for a reason. Understand?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Are you a parrot, cop? You keep repeating the same thing.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You were trapped in a cell with this dull man","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and you didn't take opportunity to smother him.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Beautiful, yes?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Please tell me this is another poor joke.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You said you had a plane.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"A plane!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No, no, no.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I… I told you I could fly you home.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And Katinka can fly you home, little bird.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She was named Katinka after my first lover.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Katinka also had very beautiful, very round buttocks.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Uh, mu… much like this.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"This cannot fly us to America.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Why not?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"As long as winds are not too strong","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and your military friends do not shoot us out of sky,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"we can make it to the coast.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"There, while we refuel,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"we skin dip in ice-cold water and wash off this muck.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Then we fly her rest of the way.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Happy ending.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay, what is the furthest Katinka has ever flown?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"For me, she is still a virgin.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Uh, not real Katinka. Goodness, no.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That Katinka, no.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But this Katinka, pretty much unspoiled.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But I'm sure she will soar when given a chance.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She just need little tune-up.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I did warn you, Jim.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Should I shoot him now? Or later?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What about Owens?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He… He's gotta have contacts or spies here that could help us.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Can we do that?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Can we make a call to the States?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yes, hello, miss.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'd like to place a call to the United States. A very sick relative.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Correct. Yes... The number is...","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"The number?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's 775…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"…305…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"…3450.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Da, spasibo.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What are you doing?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How exactly do you think this works?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They will make the call for us, and then they will call us back.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How long's that gonna take?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Five minutes. Five hours.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Five days. Who knows?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And when we do get the call,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"assume the KGB will be on the other line, listening to everything you say.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I suggest talking in code.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Say the wrong thing","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and they will be on us like flies on shit.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Welcome to the Soviet Union.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So much for avoiding angry hicks.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Let's be… fast.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yep.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Definitely.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How many of these do you think we need?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Five or six.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What are you gonna do? Stand and gawk?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Shut up.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Ah!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Jesus, you scared me.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Whoa. You gonna mace me with that?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If it keeps you in line, yeah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"See? Not so scary.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Robin. Robin!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Who's that?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Someone from band.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How much is this?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"$120.99, but I'll throw in 20 rounds of buckshot for ya.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hey, can I see this real pretty .357, please?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Sure thing.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Here you go, son.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Thank you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Nancy Wheeler.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Wouldn't expect to find you here.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah, well, it's just… scary times.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm… sorry about Chrissy.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Want my advice?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Shotguns are not good for much of anything past killing small birds.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I mean, they got power, sure,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"but not much range.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And that's just gonna force you into close-range combat,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"then someone can just grab that barrel like this…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"…and redirect it.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, you look nervous.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Like I said,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"scary times.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Now, your brother, he, uh…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Is he here with you, by chance?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Mike?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Mike.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I only ask because he's…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"He's in Hellfire, isn't he?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I don't know what you're talking about.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What about his friends?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They here with you?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Would you let go?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Let go.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What the hell is taking so long?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What happened?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Gotta go.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Your old friends are here.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Shit!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Let's go! Let's go!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm going! I'm going! Sit down!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Should be up on our right.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"There's nothing out here.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Mmm. We there already?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Already? It's been nine hours.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's gotta be around here somewhere.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What are we looking for, my dudes?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Some sort of facility.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"A fence. A building.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Any signs of life would be nice.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Since when did we decide Nina was a building and not a small woman?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Sounds like a small woman to me.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's not a small woman.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Small woman out in this desert would be hard to see.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How is he still high?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Sure you got your measurements right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yes, they're right.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You're 100%, right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yes.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Maybe latitude and longitude are wrong.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Are you really questioning Suzie?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She's a genius, Jonathan.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Even geniuses make mistakes.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, she didn't.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If that small woman is small enough, she could fit behind a small tree.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Stop! Just…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Ouch.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What are you doing?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I am stopping us before we get more lost.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Give me the coordinates.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Um, okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Longitude is 116 degrees, five minutes, and 17...","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Slow down. Slow down.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Nina!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Nina.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Nina?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Nina!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Holy macaroni.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"All right. You just go straight down. Like, straight… straight…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Right on the money, as I said.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It just doesn't make sense.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yo, dudes!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"My dudes!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Jesus Christ.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Come check this shit out!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What is it?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Gotta see it to believe it, my dudes!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Come on! Hurry!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pronto!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So no small woman named Nina.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But you said any signs of life, am I right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Right.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"these are no regular tire tracks, brochachos.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I mean, look at the tread on these monsters.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They're fatties. And you know what that means.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Military.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We gotta go.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, I wouldn't do it if I didn't think she was ready.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But either way, I don't think we have any other choice.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Do you?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No, I don't.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It might take me some time though.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Just… As fast as you can.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's gonna take us two hours to get to Nellis as it is.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And, Ellen, one more favor.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Can you send somebody over to a Max Mayfield's house?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"There are some kids there that just need looking after, okay?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Ellen? Hello?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Sam? Hello?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Why the long face, Doc?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We just wanna talk.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No! Wait!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No! No!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You can't leave, Eleven.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Where is Dr. Owens?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Dr. Owens had a change of heart.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I know you wish to go to him,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and there's nothing I can do to stop you","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"from forcing open that door.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But if my men hear you coming,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"they will kill him.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And alone, you will never find your way out of this desert to your friends.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Here's what we're going to do.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You and I are going to complete our work together.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And when I decide that you are ready,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"we will return to Hawkins, together.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Papa and daughter.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Why are you doing this?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Because there's no other choice.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"There is a choice.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Only one that is right.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And you make the right choices?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I try.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Did you make the right choice with Mama?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Four-fifty.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Your mother was sick, Eleven.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She was a danger to herself and to others.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"She brought a gun into the hospital. She killed a man.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hospital?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"A prison.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Everything I have done was for your own good.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"For your own protection.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And Henry?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You kept Henry in that lab.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"With the children.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Was that for our good?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Was that a right choice?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I had no idea what Henry would do.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I cared for you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I loved you. I loved all of you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Even Henry?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yes.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I was trying to help Henry, to understand him. Yes.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yes, I cared for him.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Even after what… what he did?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yes.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Because I knew I had failed him.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So this morning,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"you said you believed he was always alive in the darkness.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Is that why I was searching the darkness?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Was I looking for him? For Henry?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No. No.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We were focused on the Soviets.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You knew that.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"""Papa does not tell the truth.""","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Henry said that.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And now you trust Henry?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Henry, who's manipulated you like some puppet?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You are the one who released him from his prison.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And now you are angry with yourself","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and you're taking your anger out on me","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and you're risking everything.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No, you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You have risked everything!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You have lied!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You made me look for him!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"The gate.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"The Mind Flayer.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So many dead.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And all because of you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Because you could not stop.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You could not let him go.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I came here to try and understand who I was.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"To see if I…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If I was the monster.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Papa!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And now I know the truth.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It is not me.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It is you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"are the monster.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I am going to open that door,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"and I am going to leave","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"with Dr. Owens.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If you try to stop me, I will kill you.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You'll soon see the truth, Eleven.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Ah!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Is this legal?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Actually, I think it's a felony.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Right.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But it guarantees one thing.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I won't miss.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How's she feeling?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Light. But durable.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Deadly.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But reliable.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hear me now.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"There will be no more retreating…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"…from Eddie the Banished.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hey, you're really ready for bat-tle.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You get it?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"""Bat-tle.""","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"B-A-T.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I thought I had a good one.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What are you doing?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You son of a bitch!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"No wedgies! No wedgies!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Never change,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Dustin Henderson.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Promise me?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I wasn't planning on it.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Good.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Good.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Good.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hey, Sinclairs.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"How are those, uh… those spears coming on?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Flip that damn thumb around.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's too loose, Lucas.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"This isn't a basketball game","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"where they blow the whistle when your shoes fall off.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay, okay, for the record,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"my shoes never fell off.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay, for the record,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"it's kinda hard for your shoes to fall off when you're riding the bench.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yet, for some reason,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"you show up to every game.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Mmm, except the one that mattered.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Plus, Mom and Dad forced me.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Bull. Mom and Dad can't force you to do shit.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Well, even though you're a bench-riding loser,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"you're still my brother.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Just the facts.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It just doesn't make sense.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What doesn't make sense?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"That was Dan Shelter. He graduated, like, two years ago.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"So he's in college.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Which means he was visiting on spring break.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Fast Times was returned, like, I don't know, a week ago?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Right? Unless she's got some horn dog brother we don't know about.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Which is possible.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Or she's just really into Judge Reinhold?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Steve.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Nah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I don't care.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I don't understand why you do either with everything that's going on.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Honestly, this feels like a perfect time for that little pull of the rug because…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"In the face of the world ending, the stakes of my love life","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"feel spectacularly low.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah. I mean, I get you there,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"but… I still have hope.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Not everything has a happy ending.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah, yeah, believe me, I know.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I'm not talking about failed romance.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I just…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I have this terrible,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"gnawing feeling that…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It might not work out for us this time.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"You think we shouldn't be doing this?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"I think we're mad fools, the lot of us, but…","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"…but if we don't stop him, who will?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We have to try, right?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"To killing Vecna.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Slash Henry.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Slash One.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA

"But it was the only way.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"The best way.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"What's going on?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's Sullivan.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"They found us.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Go, go, go!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Three! Two! One!","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA

"And what happened here?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Hmm?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Are Mommy and Daddy fighting?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Okay.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Let's try this again, shall we?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Where's the girl?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Where do you think you're going, Doc?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Why don't you give 'em some lead?","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA

"Jack, you don't have to do this.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"It's over, Sam.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Wait! Wait! Wait! I can put her in a coma.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"A medically induced coma.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"We have the drugs. We can do it right here.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"And we'll see if… if these murders keep happening.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"If you're right, the killing ends, and you can pull the plug on her.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"In fact, I'll do it myself.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"But if you're wrong about this,","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"God, are we gonna need her.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA
"Jack.","Chapter Eight Papa","4","8",NA

"I made this choice.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And I would choose it again, even knowing everything that I know.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I would.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Plus, you know, we do have that date to get to.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"I've been dreaming about it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Oh, yeah?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I have it all planned out.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Pray tell.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I'm getting two orders of bread sticks. Two.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Those things knock your socks off.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Enzo puts some spice on 'em.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I don't know what it is, but it's good.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And you dip it in olive oil? Forget about it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And, uh, I'm wavering on the main course between the veal and the lasagne.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But I think I gotta go with lasagne, right?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"So, you… you've been dreaming about bread sticks and lasagne?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I've been on a diet of watery soup, moldy bread, and maggots,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"so, yeah, I've been dreaming about bread sticks and lasagne.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I mean, sue me.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Should I have been dreaming about something else?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You tell me.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Well,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"there's wine.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Oh, well, wine's good.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I was thinking about a nice ""Cheeanti.""","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"Then there's dessert.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"Gotta have dessert.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And after that?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"Who needs imagination?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Damn it!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Remember, they're listening!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Okay. I wanna run through it one more time.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Phase one.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"We meet Erica at the playground.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"She'll signal Max and Lucas when we're ready.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Phase two.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Max baits Vecna.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"He'll go after her, which'll put him in his trance.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Phase three?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Me and Eddie draw the bats away.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Four.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"All right.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Let's go.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Gotcha.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Hey, guys, listen.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"If things here start to go south, I mean, at all,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"you abort.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Okay? Draw the attention of the bats.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Keep 'em busy for a minute or two. We'll take care of Vecna.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Don't try to be cute or be a hero or something.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Okay? You guys are just...","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Decoys.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Don't worry. You can be the hero, Steve.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"We are not heroes.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Hey, Steve?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Make him pay.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No, no. Like I said, I… I've tried everyone.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah, TWA, Pan Am, Eastern.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No, it doesn't have to be a one-way.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I'll take one seat, if you have it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I mean, please, there has to be something that you can do.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"One of our family members is really, really sick,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"No. No. No.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Like I said before, I… I've tried them already.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"There… There's no one there?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No, that's the problem. I can't call back.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"Three.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Rainbow.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Get away!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Damn it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What'd they say?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Earliest is tomorrow.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No. That's way too late.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Shit.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I know.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Hey, dudes?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Ask 'em if we can ride in the baggage compartment.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"The baggage compartment?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"We'd suffocate.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Dogs ride in there all the time, man.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"They don't suffocate.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Jesus Christ.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Holy shit.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I have a way.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"A way to protect Max.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"From here.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"This is Max.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"When One attacks, he'll be in her mind.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But I can do that too.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I went into Mama's mind, into Billy's.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I can go into Max's.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"She can carry me to Vecna.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I can piggyback.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I can protect her.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"From One.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Fight him from here.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Mind fight. Righteous.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Wait, so you actually think this can work?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"A bathtub would help.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah. Gotta be clean to enter the mind.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What? No, no. It's a sensory deprivation tank.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It helps her calm down and focus on her powers.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Wait, we… we just passed a motel.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah, but they won't have enough salt.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Well, how much salt are we talking here, my dudes?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Well, depends on the size of the tub, but a lot.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Does 600 pounds suffice?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You know a place that has 600 pounds of salt?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Let's see…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yep.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Mm-hmm.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yep. It'll work.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What will work?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I know a magical place that has all you need,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"my brave, little super powered friend.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"That mind fight is on.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Come on.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"¡Vámonos! Let's go! Pronto!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Hey!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I think we got something.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Send Ryan.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I don't wanna waste any more time with bullshit leads.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I don't think you'll wanna send Ryan on this one.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You know the murder house on More head?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What about it?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Okay, and, uh, who exactly was this mystery woman?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Not sure.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I mean, she wasn't exactly Miss Talkative.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You know? I spent five minutes trying to convince her I was real.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I'm supposed to be dead, remember?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Anyway, I finally get around to half-convincing her,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"she starts to open up a little, then says that she's…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"A friend of the doc's.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Great, so am I. Now put me on the phone with him.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I'm afraid the doc is indisposed.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"""Indisposed""?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It gets worse.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"She said the doc's with the girl.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And the girl went off to fight some evil in Hawkins.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Then they all went off-grid. The doc, the girl, everybody.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"""The girl,"" meaning… El.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah, it has to be.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"This is your daughter, American?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Mm-hmm.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And they're not alone.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Joyce's kids are with 'em.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Okay, I… I see the mood here is bleak.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And understandably so.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But I do think we need to consider","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"the very real possibility","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"that this mystery woman is, in fact, KGB.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And she's...","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"She's telling the truth.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"When we were in the lab, those particles we saw,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"they were alive.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And if they're alive, that means a gate's open in Hawkins.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"""Gate""? What does this mean?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It means we have to go home right now.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What is taking so long?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I thought you said he was close.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah, close to sabotaging us, you mean.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"We think he's playing us again.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"So put a goddamn gun to his head.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And then what? He just spits out more lies.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's moot anyway.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"If your kids are truly in some kind of imminent danger,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"even if we were to leave this very moment, we wouldn't make it in time.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"The earliest we'd get there is late tomorrow.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No, we… we don't have to make it back.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Not tonight.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Whatever this evil is,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"we know it's connected to the hive mind.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And now we know part of that hive mind is in Russia.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"So we don't need to get back to Hawkins to fight it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"All we need is to destroy those particles.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And if we're lucky,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"it'll hurt it enough to give the kids the upper hand.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Wait, time out.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"We're talking about the particles inside the prison?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"The prison that we just narrowly escaped from?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"We broke out.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"We can break back in.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Jim!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"The entire Soviet army is looking for us.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Sure. And we'll be exactly where they least expect.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"All right. There is a fine line between courage and stupidity,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"and this falls very far on the side of stupid.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"This is Dirty Dozen stuff.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Except there are, uh, four of us.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Three, actually.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Breaking back in's gonna be easier than breaking out.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Which is why we need an airlift. This is where you come in.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I don't care what it takes.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You get Yuri in line, and you get that bird in the air.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"On it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yu… Yuri mentioned something about a flamethrower, right?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Oh, yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"This'll do.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"This'll do just fine.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You gotta be shitting me.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Trust me on this one, my dudes.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Surf's up, my dude.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Uh, whoa.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Nice shirt, my dude.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Thanks, my dude.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Uh, listen, I would love to feed a fellow Surfer Boy,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"but kitchen closed, like, five minutes ago,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"so no more pies tonight, man.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"That's all right, my dude.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"We're not here for your tasty pies.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You see this weird girl behind me?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"She needs a tub with a bunch of salt so we can enhance her psychic power","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"so she can save the world from this super bad dude.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But to make this salty tub,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"we require your kitchen.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Ah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Well, it's just, uh…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I'm supposed to meet Chaz at Taco Bell","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"in, like, ten. So…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"My dude.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"We're not asking you to help for free.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You ever partake in…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Purple Palm Tree Delight?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It'll make all your troubles float away.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Like the seed pods of a dandelion in the wind.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"First-ever mind fight held in a pizza dough freezer.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Pretty rad, right?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Not bad.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Not bad at all.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Now for the fun part.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Jesus Chr…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's like… she was destined for an alternate dimension.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What do you say, Henderson?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Are you ready for the most metal concert in the history of the world?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"That a rhetorical question?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Let's do it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Uh… I don't mean to freak anyone out,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"but I swear we've seen this tree before.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"That's impossible.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"That would suck, right?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"If Vecna destroyed the world because… 'cause we got lost in the woods?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"We're not lost, Robin.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Robin, hey. Watch out for the vines! Hive mind.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Remember?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Thank you!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Uh, Don't worry about her.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"She's just stressed.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You know, scared.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah. Yeah. I… I know.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's just…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"She's a super klutz?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"She did tell me that it took her longer to walk than most babies, so…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I really shouldn't laugh.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"When I was a baby,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I actually crawled backwards.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Crawled backwards?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You know, I'd push with my hands like this. Beep. Beep.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Always in reverse, you know?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Come on, it makes sense. You push to move, right?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No, no, it doesn't make sense.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Well, it did to my tiny little Harrington brain.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"That is, until I reversed my baby butt down a flight of stairs","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"and thumped my head really good.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Wow. That explains","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"so much.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I think it kinda does.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I think, like, right out of the gate, like, I'm super confident.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But I'm also, like, an idiot.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Which is just… I mean, it's a brutal combination.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But, I mean, the good news is,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I get a big enough thump on my head, I can change, you know?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I can learn.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I can","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"crawl forward.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Listen, I guess what I'm trying to say in a really stupid, roundabout way is, um…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"…is thank you.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Thank me?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"For…?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"For giving my head the biggest thump of its life","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"two years ago.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I needed it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's changed my life.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And now I'm crawling forward.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Slowly.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I just wonder sometimes…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You know, if… some other girl had given me a proper thump before we'd met,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"would things have been different?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Like, if we were meeting together for the first time right now, part of me…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I dunno, part of me thinks we would've made it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Steve…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Remember the dream I told you about?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"About the Winnebago?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Seeing the country with my six lil' nuggets?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's all true.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Every last word.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But I left one part out.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's the most important part.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You're there.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You've always been there.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Hey, guys!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You guys! Awesome news!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"it will come for us.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"For our families.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"For our Motherland.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"It is true.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"That hero, where is he now?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Because I do not see him.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"Come on! Do you want me or not?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Okay, almost done.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Okay, so, hopefully this blocks out any peripheral light, right?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And it's totally dark, which means it works.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But I have one more important question:","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"I just…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I dunno.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I guess I just wanted to say that...","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Surf's up, Romeo.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"Did you try? Try before you deny.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No. I...","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Try before you deny!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"Do you remember that time you told me you had a Lego stuck up your nose?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Like, it was like a… It was like a construction guy.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You'd call him Larry. Come on! You don't remember?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"He had the high viz jacket and removable hat?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Vaguely.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Well, I remember it like it was yesterday.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"'Cause… 'Cause this Larry… I mean, Larry was way, way up there.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I don't even know how you got him that far up.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I had to do surgery. I… I had to get tweezers to pull him out.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Bull.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No, no, I swear on my life.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I don't know, I just…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I feel like you used to come to me more for help.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Or to just… talk, you know?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"'Cause, like, you don't do that anymore.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Not like before.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"A lot of that is probably my fault.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"This last year…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"…I know I've been distant.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Or stoned.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Or stoned.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But that has nothing to do with you.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And that's me dealing with my own shit.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Hiding from my own problems.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"The truth is,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I miss talking to you.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I, like, really miss it.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And I think,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"right now,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"we need to talk more than ever.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Because things are getting just complicated.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"A lot more complicated than Legos up the nose, you know?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I just…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I don't want you to forget that I'm here.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And I'll always be here.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No matter what.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Because you're my brother.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And I love you.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And there is nothing in this world, okay,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"absolutely nothing,","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"that will ever change that.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You got that?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And I'm always","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"here for you too.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I know.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I know you are.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Come here.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's gonna be okay.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Yeah.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I think it's ready.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"All right.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's time.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Wild.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I found them.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"They're carrying a light.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"A blue light.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What are you waiting for, asshole?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Hmm? I'm right here.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I'm right here!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Okay, El, what's going on?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's not working.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What? What's not working?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Max's plan.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I know you can hear me.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I know you can read my thoughts.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Even the worst ones.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Maybe mostly the worst ones.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I thought about what you said.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"About how I wanted my brother to die.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I thought you were just trying to upset me.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"To anger me.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But you weren't, were you?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You were just telling the truth.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Billy, he made my life living hell.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Every chance he got.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"So, sometimes…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"When I would lie in bed at night, I would…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I would pray…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"…I would pray that something would happen to him.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Something awful.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I knew that he drove too fast, so I would imagine him","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"crashing.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Dying in that stupid car.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I just…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I wanted him out of my life.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Forever.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I wanted him to disappear.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"The day that he died…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I think that's why I just stood there.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Watched.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Not because I was scared or… weak.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But because…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I didn't know if he deserved to be saved.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And I've tried to forgive myself.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I've tried, but…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I can't.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I can't.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"So now…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Now, when I lie in bed at night…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I pray that something will happen to me.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"That something terrible will happen to me.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"So that's why I'm here.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Because…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I just want you to take me away.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"And I want you…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"To make me disappear.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Is that all true?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You wanted Billy to die.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Why are you talking?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You ever have thoughts like that about me?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"What?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No, Lucas, never.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Normal people don't fantasize about killing other people, Max.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You realize that, right?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Lucas, please.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I thought you were getting better.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"But you're not, are you?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You are sick.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Lucas, you don't mean that.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Maybe it is good he takes you.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Maybe it's for the best.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"In fact…","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"…I'm glad it's going to be you.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"You will be the chosen one.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"The fourth. The final sacrifice.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"Where are you going? Don't be scared.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Stay away from me.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Max, I thought you said you were ready.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Ready to disappear!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I said, stay away!","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Max. It's okay.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I'm coming.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I'm coming. Just hold on a little longer.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I dunno if you can hear this. I'm sorry.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"I'm so, so sorry, Billy.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Max, sweetie.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Mom?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"It's gonna be okay, baby.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA

"A Max memory.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"Do you see her? Do you see Max?","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
"No.","Chapter Nine The Piggyback","4","9",NA
